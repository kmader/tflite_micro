Getting TFLite Micro Up and Running

The repo gets and builds the tensorflow-lite for microcontrollers environment and runs the basic tests. It uses notebooks to run the tests and make it easier to debug.

## Next Steps
- Use the xeus-cling kernel to make interactive tflite-micro kernels
- Add an example for exporting a model from tensorflow and embedding it into an app
